# JGagner Personal Trainer Website

**View live project [here](https:www.google.com)

This is the main website for Joseph Gagner, personal trainer in Rolling Hills, California. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, including iPhone, iPad, Android and desktop. It is designed to be easy to navigate for potential new clients looking to hire a personal trainer that understands their concerns about exercising and nutrition. 


## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals
  - A first time visitor should be able to easily learn about Joseph Gagner, his personal journey and why he is the best professional trainer for them.
  - A first time visitor should be able to easily navigate throughout the site in a simple and intuitive way. 
  - A first time visitor should be able to quickly look at the types of services that Joseph offers and view his starting price points. This is important because displaying price points naturally weed out “tire kicker” visitors, allowing for more qualified Sign-up form submissions.
  - A first time visitor should be able to quickly look at testimonials and before/after pictures that corroborate Joseph’s training expertise and success in facilitating their transformation. 
  - A first time visitor will easily be able to contact Joseph for an initial consultation and get started on their health journey. 

### Returning Visitor Goals
  - A returning visitor’s purpose for visiting Joseph Gagner’s website would be to download the California release form required to start their training. This is easily downloaded from the footer, which is repeated on every page of the site.
  
### Design
  #### Color Scheme
  - The main colors used will be gray, white, and blue (specifically, Hex #235384).
  #### Typography
  - The primary font family will be Oswald throughout the site, with San Serif as the fallback font if such font family is not being imported. 
  #### Imagery 
  - Imagery is important. The large, background hero image on the main page is designed to be striking and evoke the emotion of accomplishment or the dawning of a new day at the end of a long journey. It also has a modern, inspirational aesthetic.
  - Header images are placed on every page. These images are meant to tie back to the theme of each page- Services, Testimonials, Start Now!
